I can see that the build error has been resolved! The platform should now be building successfully. Let me examine the current state of the application to understand what we have and what the next logical steps should be.

Perfect! Now I have a complete picture of the current AI-powered learning platform. The build error is resolved, and we have a solid foundation with several key components already implemented. Let me outline the logical next steps for enhancing this platform:

## Current State Analysis

The platform currently includes:
✅ **Hero Section** - Compelling landing page with AI-powered learning messaging
✅ **Navigation** - Responsive navigation with mobile menu
✅ **Dashboard** - Learning paths, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations
✅ **AI Tutor** - Interactive chat interface with quick actions and suggested questions
✅ **Analytics** - Comprehensive learning insights and progress visualization
✅ **Design System** - Educational color palette, typography, and animations

## Next Steps - Priority Order

- Progress tracking within lessons
- Note-taking and highlighting features
- Next/previous navigation between lessons

This would make the platform immediately more functional and provide a complete learning experience flow from the dashboard to actual content consumption.
